The 4 PDF files are exports from my past PCB projects.Folder "Other hand soldered projects" contains pictures of electronic systems I had previously built with my teammates.

STM32103C8_baseboard_V2.pdf is the control board for my navigation smart car project when doing the "Intel cup Embedded system design contest" in 2016. This control board has a two-channel motor driver, and a servo interface, for movement control; encoder interface for speed feedback; gyroscope interface for position sensing; and UART interface for Bluetooth communication. The board also integrated two power IC to convert battery power to suitable voltages for the various components on the smart car.

MicroMouse.pdf is the PCB hardware I designed for my teammate who was doing the internation Micro Mouse competition. It is a small robot half the size of a palm. There are 4 IR sensors to allow it  detect surroundings in a maze and decide the best rout from start to finish point, 2 wheels and motor assemlied on the side board to allow it perfom motions such as 90 degree turn, 180 degree turn, forward and backward rush.

LightMedical_v1.pdf is an interst driven project, to test whether relatively high levels of exposure to red and blue LED radiation can indeed reduce acne grownth.

GSM.pdf is a GSM module, made to enable upper computer to send text messages through this interface.


Thank you for your time.
