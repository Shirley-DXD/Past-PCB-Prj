The three PDF files are exports from my past PCB project.

STM32103C8_baseboard_V2.pdf is the control board for my navigation smart car project when doing the "Intel cup Embedded system design contest" in 2016. This control board has a two-channel motor driver, and a servo interface, for movement control of the car; encoder interface for speed feedback; gyroscope interface for position sensing; and UART interface for Bluetooth communication. The board also integrated two power IC to convert battery power to suitable voltages for the various components on the smart car.

GSM.pdf is a GSM module, made to enable upper computer send text messages through this interface.

Folder "Other hand soldered projects" contain pictures of electronic systems I had previously built with my teammates.
